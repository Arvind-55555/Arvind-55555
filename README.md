# Hi, I'm Arvind — AI & Data Science Engineer  

Building **full-stack AI/ML systems** that integrate data pipelines, model development, and production deployment.

---

## About Me  

I’m an **AI & Data Science Engineer** specializing in **Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Data Engineering**.  
My work bridges the gap between **research and production**, focusing on scalable **LLM pipelines**, **RAG systems**, and **GeoAI models** for environmental and spatial intelligence.  

I have hands-on experience in creating **data-driven architectures** — from ingestion and transformation to **model training and deployment** using tools like **Docker, FastAPI, LangChain, and cloud-native services**.

## Interests & Focus Areas  

- **GeoAI & Environmental Modeling** – analyzing satellite and spatial datasets for environmental change detection.  
- **LLM & RAG Systems** – building retrieval-augmented generation pipelines with hybrid search and custom LLM generation layers.  
- **End-to-End ML Pipelines** – automating data processing, feature engineering, and model lifecycle management.  
- **AI for Impact** – leveraging data and AI to address sustainability, urban planning, and intelligent transport challenges.
