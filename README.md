A comprehensive end-to-end machine learning platform that combines real-time environmental monitoring with AI-driven restoration scenario optimization. The system processes multi-source environmental data to provide actionable insights for ecosystem restoration planning.

**Technical Achievements:**

- Developed 5 production ML models with XGBoost achieving 99.75% accuracy (R² = 0.9975, RMSE = 2.21 µg/m³)
- Built interactive real-time dashboard using React and FastAPI architecture
- Processed and analyzed 18 datasets totaling 16,222 environmental records
- Engineered 89 features through advanced time-series analysis techniques
- Identified potential for 33% PM2.5 reduction through optimized intervention strategies
- Deployed production-ready REST API with 8 endpoints for real-time predictions

**Technology Stack:** Python, React, FastAPI, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Prophet, LSTM Networks, Tailwind CSS, 

**Data Sources:** Based on IPCC AR6 framework utilizing NASA POWER API, World Bank data, and data from data.gov.in
